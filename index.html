        <h2 id="Mx">Mexican radio spectrum</h2>
        <p>
            In Mexico, the administration of the radioelectric spectrum is managed by the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT), which regulates and controls its use in accordance with national and international standards. Mexico is part of the ITU Region 2, alongside other countries in the Americas, meaning it adheres to ITU agreements and recommendations regarding frequency use.        </p>
        <p><br>“Mexico’s radio spectrum is managed with a focus on maximizing efficiency and avoiding interference among services, especially in densely populated areas where demand for connectivity is high.”  (Federal Institute of Telecommunications, Mexico)</p>
            <h2 id="main-bands">Main Bands: VHF and UHF</h2>
        <p>
            VHF (Very High Frequency): Covers frequencies between 30 MHz and 300 MHz. In Mexico, this band is primarily used for FM radio (88-108 MHz), maritime and aeronautical communications, and open TV services on channels 2 to 13 (54-216 MHz).        </p>
        <p>
            UHF (Ultra High Frequency): Covers frequencies from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. In Mexico, the UHF band is used for digital TV services (channels 14-36 in the 470-698 MHz range), mobile phone services, mobile communication systems, and some satellite services.        </p>
        <h2 id="free-frequency">License-Free Frequencies (ISL - Industrial, Scientific, and Medical)</h2>
        <p>
            Mexico has license-free frequency bands, which do not require a license for use but are subject to technical regulations to avoid interference. The most common license-free bands are:        </p>

        <h2 id="1">General Band and Service Distribution</h2> 
<p>
    AM Radio: 
    Bands from 535 kHz to 1705 kHz, where amplitude modulation radio stations are located.
</p><p>
    FM Radio: 
    Bands from 88 MHz to 108 MHz, reserved for frequency modulation radio.
</p><p>
    Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT):

</p><p>
    Mobile Telephony: 
    Found in the 800 MHz, 1900 MHz, and 2.5 GHz bands, and recently in the 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz bands for technologies like 4G LTE and 5G.
</p><p>
    Satellite Services: 
    The L (1-2 GHz), S (2-4 GHz), C (4-8 GHz), Ku (12-18 GHz), and Ka (26.5-40 GHz) bands are used for various satellite communication services, including internet and television.
</p>

<h2 id="important">Other Important Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Mexico also participates in international ITU conferences to review and coordinate spectrum standards and regulations globally, tailoring its spectrum policy to the local needs of telecommunications, broadcasting, and satellite services.        </p>

<h2 id="2">Importance of the Radioelectric Spectrum in Mexico</h2> 
<p>
Transmission Medium: ADSL uses existing copper lines, while FTTH uses fiber-optic cables, which are far superior in terms of speed and capacity.
</p><p>Signal Type: ADSL transmits electrical signals, while FTTH transmits light, enabling much faster speeds and more reliable connections.
</p><p>Distance Sensitivity: ADSL suffers from signal degradation over long distances, while FTTH maintains high performance over much greater distances.
</p>
<p><br>“To accommodate the increasing need for wireless communication, Mexico’s spectrum policies now incorporate concepts like Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and spectrum sharing, aiming to enable multiple users within the same band under controlled conditions.” (IFT Technical Reports on Spectrum Innovation, 2022)</p>
<h2 id="DSA">Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Spectrum Sharing</h2> 
<p>
    With increasing demand for wireless communication, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Spectrum Sharing are becoming crucial in maximizing spectrum efficiency. These approaches allow multiple users or services to share the same frequency band under specific conditions, especially in areas with high demand for connectivity or limited spectrum availability.
<br>
    In Mexico, the IFT has begun exploring policies for shared spectrum access to optimize frequency use, especially in urban regions with dense population centers where demand for mobile data and wireless internet is high. 
 <br></br>   Some key aspects include:</p><p>White Space Utilization: White spaces refer to unused or underutilized spectrum in the VHF and UHF bands. DSA technology can identify and allocate these spaces dynamically to different users, such as rural broadband or IoT (Internet of Things) networks, without causing interference.
    <br>Secondary Spectrum Use: Allows secondary users to access certain frequencies without affecting primary licensed services. This approach is used mainly for experimental purposes, such as IoT applications and non-critical communications in regions where spectrum is underutilized.</p>
    <br><h2 id="3">Licensing Models and Unlicensed Spectrum Expansion</h2> <p>
        Mexico also adapts its licensing models to encourage innovation:<br>
        Exclusive Licensing: Traditional licensing where spectrum rights are exclusively assigned to one entity. This model is used for cellular operators in key bands like 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz for 4G/5G services.
    </p><p>
        Unlicensed Spectrum Expansion: Expanding unlicensed frequencies, especially in Wi-Fi bands (like 6 GHz), is becoming vital to improve wireless capacity in urban and public areas, supporting smart cities and high-density data environments.
    </p>    
    <p><br>“Expanding unlicensed spectrum access, particularly in Wi-Fi bands, is key to supporting high-density urban areas and fostering innovation for applications in smart cities and IoT.” (ITU Regional Reports, Region 2 - Mexico)</p>
    <!-- Conclusions Section -->
        <div class="conclusions" id="conclusions">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                CHRISTOFER EDWARD ->  Proper management of the radio spectrum is essential to ensure the orderly and efficient operation of critical services such as telephony, internet, and emergency systems. By dividing and regulating frequencies, it promotes a technological environment where multiple services can coexist without interference, driving connectivity and the development of new technologies for the benefit of society.
            </p><p>
                CARLOS ALFONSO ->  These initiatives position Mexico to effectively support future technologies, including 5G, IoT, and smart cities, meeting both current and emerging connectivity demands.
            </p>
            <p>DIEGO JIMENEZ ->  In summary, Mexico's management of the radioelectric spectrum, overseen by the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT), plays a critical role in ensuring efficient, reliable, and innovative use of frequencies. With dedicated bands for services like FM/AM radio, digital television, and cellular networks, as well as unlicensed bands for Wi-Fi and IoT applications, Mexico supports diverse communication needs while adhering to international ITU guidelines.</p>
            <p>ERIKA COTONIETO ->   The State is responsible for maintaining control of the radio spectrum, according to article 10 of the LFT, since it classifies it for exploitation according to the use of its bands.</p>
